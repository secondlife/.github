# Code of Conduct
These guidelines apply to all official development communication channels  
(GitHub Issues, Slack, mailing lists, Discord, and forums). They also apply
to activities that take place on [secondlife.com](http://secondlife.com), 
within our various development programs, and in-world. These guidelines are 
provided in addition to Second Life's general [Community Standards][].

Send reports of violations to opensource-moderators@lindenlab.com so Lindens 
can handle them on a case-by-case basis. Debate about infractions is always 
off-topic in official development community channels.

We recognize that misunderstandings and mistakes can happen. We will only 
take action after repeated intentional violations. Repeated violations may 
result in being restricted from our open source program, suspension from 
the Third Party Viewer Program, or both.

#### Be respectful and considerate:

- Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks.  
- Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive
  one.

#### Be patient and generous if someone asks for help:

- Suggest specific documentation or troubleshooting steps, or suggest more
  appropriate venues if applicable.  
- Avoid aggressive or vague responses.  
- If a question isn’t worth your time, others may still enjoy answering.

#### Assume people mean well:

- Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing
  priorities.
- If you disagree, please do so politely.  
- If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it.  
- Ask for clarification, but do not assume the worst.

#### Help others help you:

- Be respectful of others' time.  
- When asking a question, meet others halfway. Let them know what you've
  already tried or where you've already looked.  
- If you struggle to word your question, one helpful question format is
  “Here’s what I tried, here’s what I expected, and here’s what happened instead.”  
- Find additional advice in [How to Ask Smart Questions][smart].

#### Try to be concise:

- Avoid repeating what has been said already.  
- Shorter conversations are easier to follow.  
- People may feel personally attacked if they receive multiple messages saying the
  same thing.

#### Work with the community, not against it:

- Avoid actions that undermine or damage other Viewer projects or other contributors’
  work. Intentional friction, controversy, or antagonism are never appropriate.  
- Respect the autonomy, direction, development processes, and release cycles of other
  Viewer projects and contributors.  
- If you are a TPV program participant, you must adhere to Second Life's Third Party
  Viewer policies in addition to this code of conduct.
